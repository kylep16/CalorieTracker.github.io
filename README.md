CAL PAL 

My coding language that makes calorie counting fun and easy


Define the start and ends of your program with Start Track and End Track

You start by adding your height and weight so we can calculate your BMI

Then your goal and the mode you want to use 

Add your calories and the food you ate as you please and let the language do the rest

The panda will judge your progress and either praise you or hold you accountable!
